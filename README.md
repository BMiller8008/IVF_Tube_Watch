# IVF_Tube_Watch

A unique project to design and build a **wearable watch** using the **IVL2-7/5 vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) tube**. This watch blends retro technology with modern features, offering a stylish, functional, and durable timepiece. The watch is designed to be practical for daily wear while showcasing the charm of vintage display technology.

## **Design Requirements**
### Display
- **Tube:** The watch will use the IVL2-7/5 VFD tube as the time display.
- **Visibility Control:** Users can disable the tubes to conserve power while keeping the time functionality active.

### Power
- **Battery Life:** The watch must operate for at least **24 hours** on a single charge.
- **Charging:** Rechargeable via **USB-C** cable.

### Timekeeping
- **Adjustability:** Time can be set using **rotary dials** for ease of use.
- **Accuracy:** The watch must lose less than **1 minute per day**.

### Wearability
- **Size:** Designed to be **wearable** and comfortable without being excessively large.
- **Durability:** Resistant to daily use, including some water exposure (non-submersible but splash-proof).
